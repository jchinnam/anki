## అండి (_Andi_) and గారు (_gaa-ru_) as signs of respect
The word నమస్కారమండి (_nama-SKAAra-mandi_) is used to greet people. However, నమస్కారం (_nama-SKAA-ram_) is also used to greet people. The inflection అండి (_Andi_) is added to నమస్కారం (_nama-SKAA-ram_) to show respect while speaking to people who are older and/or in higher positions.  It is important to note that అండి (_Andi_) is added to most verbs to make them more respectful.

Another important way of showing respect is to add గారు (_gaa-ru_) when addressing someone by their name.

## verbs at end of sentences
The sentence structure of Telugu is different from that of English.  In English, the main verb of the sentence comes first and is followed by the secondary verb in the dependent clause or phrase.  However, in Telugu the opposite is true. In Telugu, the main verb comes at the end of the sentence.

## bye = will come
To say bye to people you say వస్తా (_vaas-taa_), which literally means "will come." It is customary in Telugu that you will take leave with the hope of meeting again, and even though there are words like వెళ్తా (_veL-taa_) which literally mean "will go," it is culturally appropriate to use వస్తా (_vaas-taa_).

## relationship words
Telugu speakers have different and specific words for relationships unlike in English. This is because of the joint family system which commonly existed until the end of 20th century. Thus, for instance, the word చెల్లెలు (_che-Lle-lu_) means "younger sister" and అక్క (_aa-ka_) means "older sister."

You cannot simply say "brother" in Telugu. You need to specify whether he is younger or older than you. Thus you say తమ్ముడు (_ta-Mmudu_) for "younger brother" and అన్నయ్య (_a-nNa-Ya_) for "older brother."

## grammatical case endings
మీరు (_Mee-ru_) means, "you."   మీకు (_mee-ku_) is also translated as "you" but additionally indicates "relation to you."  This is because Telugu applies different endings to words to indicate their function in the sentence.  This is referred to as grammatical case.  Telugu has numerous grammatical cases, for example, there are specific case endings for the subject or "doer" of the action, the object and, the location.  There are even case endings for different types of movements, e.g., movement to or out of something, to the surface of something, etc.  These endings will also differ depending on if the noun is singular or plural, animate or inanimate.

## gendered subject-verb agreements
In Telugu, the subject-verb agreement is gendered. It is either masculine or feminine. The suffix డు (_du_) represents a masculine subject and ది (_di_) represents feminine. Thus you will see that the word ఉన్నాడు (_u-Nnaa-du_) ends with the suffix డు (_du_). If it is about a "sister," then the word will be ఉన్నది (_u-Nna-di_).

## here: ఇక్కడే (_i-ka-dE_) vs ఇక్కడ (_ikka-da_)
The difference between ఇక్కడే (_i-ka-dE_) and ఇక్కడ (_ikka-da_) is contextual. Both are correct and you can use ఇక్కడే (_i-ka-dE_) in the case where the speaker would want to emphasize that something is here only, nowhere else.

## verbs default to feminine
Verbs in Telugu must agree with the gender of their subject in the sentence.  All things and animals (unless their gender is specified) are considered feminine in Telugu, and thus the verb will end with ది (_di_).

## she, informal and formal
ఆమె (_aa-me_) is "she."  This form of "she" is a general word used to refer to any woman.  However, ఆవిడ (_aa-vi-da_) is used for older women or to show respect.

## -ఆ (_-aa_) for a question
An important inflection in Telugu is ఆ (_aa_). It is often added to the verb to turn the sentence into a question. The actual word here is అనుకుంటున్నావు (_a-nu-kun-tun-naa-vu_). As you notice by changing the last vowel sound to ఆ you can make it into a question. Thus అనుకుంటున్నావా (_a-nu-kun-tun-naa-vaa_) is a question.

## friends are gendered
Friend is a gendered category in Telugu. One can have a "female friend" (స్నేహితురాలు, _snE-hi-tu-raa-lu_) or a "male friend" (స్నేహితుడు, _snE-hi-tu-du_).

## words as objects
You previously learned మీరు (_Mee-ru_) means "you" (formal).  Here we use మిమ్మల్ని (_mi-ma-li_) because "you" is the object of the sentence.  Recall how Telugu uses different endings to show the function of words in the sentence.  This is why you may come across words that are the same in English but have more than one translation in Telugu.
