# sentence structure

The simple sentence structure in Telugu is noun-noun-verb (subject-object-verb) so in most cases the verb comes after the noun in the predicate.

## verbs at end of sentences

The sentence structure of Telugu is different from that of English.  In English, the main verb of the sentence comes first and is followed by the secondary verb in the dependent clause or phrase.  However, in Telugu the opposite is true. In Telugu, the main verb comes at the end of the sentence.

## auxiliary verbs

Auxiliary verbs like "am," "is," and "are" are not used in Telugu.

# grammatical case endings

Telugu applies different endings to words to indicate their function in the sentence.  This is referred to as grammatical case.  Telugu has numerous grammatical cases, for example, there are specific case endings for the subject or "doer" of the action, the object and, the location.  

There are even case endings for different types of movements, e.g., movement to or out of something, to the surface of something, etc.  These endings will also differ depending on if the noun is singular or plural, animate or inanimate.

## you

- **explicitly**
    - నువ్వు `nu-vu` means “you”, informally
    - మీరు `mee-ru` means, "you" formally
- **in relation to**: మీకు `mee-ku` is also translated as "you" but additionally indicates "relation to you."
- **as an object**: మిమ్మల్ని `mi-ma-li` when "you" is the object of the sentence

# gendered words

## verbs

### subject-verb agreement

In Telugu, the subject-verb agreement is gendered. It is either masculine or feminine. The suffix డు `du` represents a masculine subject and ది `di` represents feminine. Thus you will see that the word ఉన్నాడు `u-Nnaa-du` ends with the suffix డు `du`. If it is about a "sister," then the word will be ఉన్నది `u-Nna-di`.

### default to feminine

Verbs in Telugu must agree with the gender of their subject in the sentence.  All things and animals (unless their gender is specified) are considered feminine in Telugu, and thus the verb will end with ది `di`.

### nouns

Friend is a gendered category in Telugu. One can have a "female friend" (స్నేహితురాలు, `snE-hi-tu-raa-lu`) or a "male friend" (స్నేహితుడు, `snE-hi-tu-du`).

# questions

## inflection ఆ `-aa`

An important inflection in Telugu is ఆ `aa`. It is often added to the verb to turn the sentence into a question. The actual word here is అనుకుంటున్నావు `a-nu-kun-tun-naa-vu`. As you notice by changing the last vowel sound to ఆ you can make it into a question. Thus అనుకుంటున్నావా `a-nu-kun-tun-naa-vaa` is a question.

# post-positions

In Telugu, unlike in English, there are only 'post-﻿positions' and no 'pre-﻿positions'. This means that తెలుగులో `te-lu-gu-LO` literally means, "Telugu in".

## suffix లో `-LO`: in, within, among

లో `-LO` is a very important preposition in Telugu and is often attached to the word it follows. You will hear లో `-LO` many times in conversation, and it means "in," "inside," "within," or "among.”

# particles

Unlike English, in Telugu there are no comparative or superlative forms of adjectives. You use particles for this.

## ఇంకా `in-kaa`

ఇంకా `in-kaa` can be used to mean "more," "some more," "even more," "yet," or "still.”

# respect

## formal vs informal

### you

మీరు `mee-ru` means, "you [plural]" and నువ్వు `nu-vu` is "you [singular]." However, మీరు `mee-ru` can also be used as "you [singular] (in a formal situation)," especially when speaking to strangers and elders, and నువ్వు `nu-vu` (you [singular]) is used informally with family and friends.

### she

ఆమె `aa-me` is "she."  This form of "she" is a general word used to refer to any woman.  ఆవిడ `aa-vi-da` is used for older women or to show respect.

## అండి `andi` on verbs

The word నమస్కారమండి `nama-SKAAra-mandi` is used to greet people. However, నమస్కారం `nama-SKAA-ram` is also used to greet people. The inflection అండి `andi` is added to నమస్కారం `nama-SKAA-ram` to show respect while speaking to people who are older and/or in higher positions.  It is important to note that అండి `andi` is added to most verbs to make them more respectful.

## గారు `gaa-ru` on names

Another important way of showing respect is to add గారు `gaa-ru` when addressing someone by their name.

# misc cultural notes

## bye as "will come"

To say bye to people you say వస్తా `vaas-taa`, which literally means "will come." It is customary in Telugu that you will take leave with the hope of meeting again, and even though there are words like వెళ్తా `veL-taa` which literally mean "will go," it is culturally appropriate to use వస్తా `vaas-taa`.

## relationship words

Telugu speakers have different and specific words for relationships unlike in English. This is because of the joint family system which commonly existed until the end of 20th century. Thus, for instance, the word చెల్లెలు `che-Lle-lu` means "younger sister" and అక్క `aa-ka` means "older sister."

You cannot simply say "brother" in Telugu. You need to specify whether he is younger or older than you. Thus you say తమ్ముడు `ta-Mmudu` for "younger brother" and అన్నయ్య `a-nNa-Ya` for "older brother."

## here: ఇక్కడే `i-ka-dE` vs ఇక్కడ `ikka-da`

The difference between ఇక్కడే `i-ka-dE` and ఇక్కడ `ikka-da` is contextual. Both are correct and you can use ఇక్కడే `i-ka-dE` in the case where the speaker would want to emphasize that something is here only, nowhere else.

## english words

The United States is called అమెరికా `ame-ri-kaa` in Telugu.

Most of the current generation Telugus can follow and speak broken English. Also in day-﻿to-﻿day conversation you will notice that about 40% of the conversational words (like "fan," "car," "bus," "spoon," etc.) are English words.
