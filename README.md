## cards
the deck is made up of optional reverse cards, where the front is in english and the back is in telugu--**recall cards**; if the optional `Add Reverse` field is populated with any text, the card also produces a reverse card with the telugu side on the front and english on the back--**recognition cards**

see [`cards/`](/cards/) for note type html and css
